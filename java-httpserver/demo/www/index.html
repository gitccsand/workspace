      It&#39;s an HTTP server, written in JAVA!
    </h2>
    <hr class="notop">
<p>This is a slightly modified version of the underlying HTTP server used by <a href="http://storytellersoftware.com">Storyteller</a>. One of the issues we found while rewriting Storyteller's HTTP server was that there really isn't a nice, easy to integrate HTTP server available for Java. As such, we wrote our own, which is now here, waiting for you to use it.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<p>java-httpserver has three main components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>HTTPServer</strong>, a really simple class that usually runs in the background, waiting for requests, and sending them off to the <em>HTTPRequest</em> class to get things done.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>HTTPRequest</strong>, a class that takes in a Socket, reads from it, and splits apart the incoming data into its component parts (provided that the incoming Socket is following the HTTP protocol).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>HTTPHandler</strong>, an abstract class whos subclasses are used to actually do things with the data. It also sends stuff back to the client.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There's also an <code>HTTPException</code>, and <code>DeathHandler</code>, which are used when bad things occur. Don't let bad things occur.</p>
<h2 id="demo">Demo?</h2>
<p>You can test this out by running the provided Driver. It includes a <code>FileHandler</code>, a <code>HelloHandler</code>, and a <code>MathHandler</code>. The demo takes you to our javadoc pages by default. If you want to see the math or hello handlers, you can go to <code>/math/add/1/2</code> or <code>/hello/firstname/lastname</code> or many other paths that we have setup. See the constructors of those classes for more information.</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>See our <a href="javadoc/index.html">Javadoc</a> for documentation</p>
<p>The <code>javadoc</code> directory includes the generated javadoc for all of the included files. Additionally, each file is fairly well documented (some are a little lacking, but that's one of the two things being worked on right now).</p>
<h2 id="helping-out">Helping out</h2>
<p>If you see something fishy, or want to contribute in any way, including fixing any obvious issue (and even the non-obvious ones), please submit a pull request, or make an issue, or email me (Don Kuntz, don@kuntz.co).</p>
<p>Really, if you think something needs fixing, feel free to mention it, and if we agree, we'll make the fix.</p>
